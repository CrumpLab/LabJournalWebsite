<b>Hi! I am Utsab. I am a proactive and fast learning individual with strong analytical and quantitaive skills. I am currently looking to work in dynamic data analytics role where I can utilize my relevant expertise to help the company achieve business goals while sticking to company's vision, mission and values.</b>

<h1>BACKGROUND</h1>

I have spent the past 5 years doing number crunching, database management, business analysis, creating data reports and I am keen to continue developing my career in the field of data analytics. I have always been a numbers person, with exceptional mathematics and computer skills. I am fluent in several data management systems and software, including Excel, Microsoft SQL Server, Python, R and Power BI. Statistical significance, A/B testing, and data-driven optimization are some of the areas of my expertise.

As much as I’m into data manipulation, it’s the analysis of data that really gets me going. I like to explore the relationships between data and translate digits and spreadsheets into stories. In the age of big data, these stories become actionable solutions and strategies for businesses, and I take pride in my ability to make data accessible to both executive decision-makers and frontline sales staff.

In my last role, as a business intelligence analyst for an online travel agency, I worked with cross-functional teams to structure problems, identify appropriate data sources, extract data and develop integrated information delivery solutions. I was leading the analysis on pricing opportunities, customer behavior, and competitive positioning to build a long-term pricing strategy for the firm.  

On a personal level, I am detail-oriented, organized, and precise in my work. I have strong communication skills with a knack for clear and illuminating presentation. I’m comfortable on my own facing the numbers, but I really enjoy being part of a motivated team of smart people.

I have completed my graduate program in Predictive Analytics, and I have bachelor’s degree in computer information systems with business concentration.

Besides spreadsheets and charts, I am passionate about nature and mountains, and live an active lifestyle.
