# **Utsab Shrestha**

I am a proactive and fast learning individual with strong analytical and quantitaive skills seeking to work in dynamic data analytics role that utilizes analytical and methodical skills and relevant expertise to help the company achieve business goals while sticking to company's vision, mission and values.

## Background

I have spent the past 5 years doing number crunching, database management, business analysis, and I am keen to continue developing my career in the field of data analytics. I have always been a numbers person, with exceptional mathematics and computer skills. I am fluent in several data management systems and software, including Excel, SQL, Python and Power BI. Statistical significance, A/B testing, and data-driven optimization are the some of the skillsets I possess.

As much as I’m into data manipulation, it’s the analysis of data that really gets me going. I like to explore the relationships between data and translate digits and spreadsheets into stories. In the age of big data, these stories become actionable solutions and strategies for businesses, and I take pride in my ability to make data accessible to both executive decision-makers and frontline sales staff.

In my last role, as a business intelligence analyst for an online travel agency, I worked with cross-functional teams to structure problems, identify appropriate data sources, extract data and develop integrated information delivery solutions. I was leading the analysis on pricing opportunities, customer behavior, and competitive positioning to build a long-term pricing strategy for the firm.  

On a personal level, I am detail-oriented, organized, and precise in my work. I have strong communication skills with a knack for clear and illuminating presentation. I’m comfortable on my own facing the numbers, but I really enjoy being part of a motivated team of smart people.

I have completed my graduate program in Predictive Analytics, and I have bachelor’s degree in computer information systems with business concentration.
