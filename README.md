My Portfolio


Hello all, this porfolio is an attempt of documenting all my side projects. Over the years, I worked on a lot of machine learning projects but they were never documented at one place. This is an ever evolving repository and I will try to keep this updated.

Huge shoutout to Matt Crump from Crumplab. This template is taken from that git repo.
